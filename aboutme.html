    <p>Hello! My name is Selah (Say-La) Andrelea Williams. I currently live in Atlanta, Georgia with my Mom, my Dad, my two younger sisters, my dog, Henry, and my turtle, Donatello. </p>
    <p> I am seventeen years old and a rising senior at Dekalb School of the Arts. At DSA, I study vocal music and creative writing, both arts areas that I have always been extremely passionate about. After graduation, I hope to study Music Therapy as well as classical voice.
